"Hi, Doctor. Lately, I've been struggling with sensory issues. Certain fabrics in my clothes irritate me, and loud noises, like vacuum cleaners, are unbearable. I often wear headphones to block out sounds, but it's not always possible. Social settings are exhausting because I can't predict how people will react to me. I try to avoid eye contact because it makes me uncomfortable. At night, I have trouble sleeping because my mind is racing with thoughts about the next day."

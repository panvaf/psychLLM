"Good afternoon, Doctor. I've been experiencing heightened anxiety in social situations. Meeting new people is particularly challenging for me because I fear being judged. I rely on scripts to navigate conversations, but they don't always work. Sensory overload is a common issue; bright lights and strong smells can make me feel nauseous. I have a strong preference for predictable routines, and deviations make me anxious. Engaging in repetitive behaviors, like tapping my fingers, helps me cope with stress."

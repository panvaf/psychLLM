"Good morning, Doctor. I've noticed that I get really anxious when there are unexpected changes in my daily routine. For example, if I planned to work on my computer all morning but something else comes up, I feel unsettled. I also have specific interests that I spend a lot of time on, like trains and their schedules. Sometimes, I find it hard to understand jokes or sarcasm, which makes socializing tricky. I appreciate when people are direct with me because it helps me understand better."

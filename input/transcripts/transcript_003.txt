"Hello, Doctor. I find it difficult to make and keep friends because I don't always understand social cues. Sometimes, I take things literally, which leads to misunderstandings. I prefer solitary activities like reading or drawing because they don't require interacting with others. Changes in my environment, like moving to a new house, cause me significant stress. I use a planner to keep track of my tasks, which helps me stay organized. However, unexpected events disrupt my focus."
